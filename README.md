### summary

This project was build in the Dave Gray`s lessons. The focus was to understand how we can create a login system both frontend and backend;
In the tutorial, I could understand:
- how we use jwt and authenticate the user;
- how we use and generate access tokens and refresh tokens;
- the difference between authentication and authorization;
- how we manage the states and routes using React Context and React Router;
- how we implement persistency;
- how we implement authorization;
- how we use cookies;
- how we can use localStorage;
- how we create and use custom hooks;
- and how the frontend send and receives information to the backend;
